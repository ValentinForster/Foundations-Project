Research Questions:
We are interested in the relationship between the popularity 
measurement of musicians, as output by Spotify, and the number of 
followers of an artist on Spotify.
For the second Research Question, we originally planned to test the 
tendency of artists to collaborate with different artists within their 
genre and similar popularity. But after viewing the available Spotify 
data, which did not have specific information about collaborations, we 
decided to assess a different topic in more detail. For further 
analysis, we will look at the top 100 songs of 2022 and evaluate what 
the most critical features (like danceability, energy, liveness, â€¦) 
were and if there are any features correlated with a song's popularity.

Hypotheses:
The popularity measurement of an artist correlates positively with the 
number of followers. The higher the popularity measurement of an 
artist, the higher the number of followers.
There are correlations between the different features of songs and 
their popularity. Certain features are more important for the 
popularity of a song.
